      <hr />
      <p class="lead">Over the last 3 months, I have been working on building a SQL database from scratch in C++ on a team of two. I
        gave it the name SQLightning because it is light and fast. When we first started, I was simply overwhelmed by
        the amount of work ahead of us. This is a system with over 50 components, and the beginning is always the
        toughest. We need to build a tokenizer to process user input, a storage system to store data, a typed stream
        encoder to ensure consistency in our database, GUI in the terminal, an index and cache system to optimize
        performance, and so much more. But the individual components were not the biggest challenge. The real challenge
        is how to integrate these components into one Application through well-designed abstractions and interfaces.
        These timeless abstractions allow us to flexibly add new features and build software that could evolve.</p>

      <p>
        The single most important thing I have learned on this journey is that the perception of how long the software
        would last makes a huge impact. Most of us in the university are used to thinking about software in terms of
        hours or days, at most weeks. We might finish a PA and never think about it ever again. But when you actually
        know that this is something you will continue to work on, and your design decision will affect your work in the
        future, it shifts your perspective from quick and hacky code to building robust, flexible, and quality software
        that is pleasant to work with. We have had technical debts at certain points of the project, but we made
        incremental plans to resolve them one by one.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was both amazed and humbled after the stress test was passed and we were able to handle more than a million
        records in our database with index and cache turned on. I thought this is a good time to reflect on the progress
        we have made in writing efficient and expressive code, software architecture, and system design. I look forward
        to more interesting and meaningful challenges and making quality software that lasts longer than I would have
        imagined.
