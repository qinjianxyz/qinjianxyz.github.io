        <b>Bitcoin Does Not Work; Alternatives Could</b>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        People like me have always wanted a truly free currency where the
        meaning of money is the in the simplest form of transaction and exchange
        of goods and services. The U.S. dollar is the closest international
        currency to accomplish this goal because the economic power of the U.S.
        and the U.S. dollar is also backed by the strongest military in the
        world. Unfortunately, the complex financial system makes this simple
        dream nearly impossible. Almost every transaction is taxed and
        monitored. There is nothing intrinsically wrong of tracking
        transactions. But it is difficult to persuade that the ice cream sale at
        the street corner really has something to do with the latest military
        equipment in a foreign military base. I believe the emergence of bitcoin
        is caused by such fundamental and fervent desires to just make free
        transactions. But the truth is that at this stage, Bitcoin is not
        functional either as a currency or an investment. In this article, I
        would discuss the challenges Bitcoin faces and how future technology
        could achieve its promises if the global governments ever allow it to
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several reasons why bitcoin is not a good investment if it
        counts as investment at all. The most prominent reason is that there is
        no intrinsic value of profits or production of any goods or services
        coming out of bitcoin. It is a slightly different case to use bitcoin as
        a currency because every single currency has value only because people
        believe it has value. But in terms of investment, people who are rushing
        into the market are only expecting that someone else is willing to buy
        the bitcoin at a higher price than when they bought it. There is no free
        money like that in the world especially when something literally does
        not produce any profits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second most important reason why bitcoin does not work as an
        investment is because many people are trading derivatives of bitcoin
        instead of the real bitcoin using blockchain. For example, let us
        consider the popular trading platform Robinhood, which recently has
        allowed its customers to purchase bitcoin on its platform. If anyone
        purchases bitcoin through Robinhood, the person is not getting a real
        bitcoin with a public key and private key pair to access in the
        blockchain. From my perspective, derivative trading for bitcoin goes
        against every founding principle of a decentralized currency and it is
        destined to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        After looking at two compelling reasons why we should not use bitcoin as
        an investment, let us consider a slightly different question: can we use
        bitcoin as a mainstream currency then? There are many problems with
        using bitcoin as a main currency. To begin with, bitcoin can be very
        easily used for distortion and scam and money laundering. After all, we
        are talking about a currency that is completely anonymous and I am not
        sure people would appreciate this fact as much when a large scale of
        criminal activities happen. Furthermore, if anyone wants to trade
        bitcoin in the United States, it is likely that their identity needs to
        be verified through their social security. This fact actually makes me
        want to laugh because if bitcoin is completely monitored by the
        government, it has no difference from any other currency. You could pay
        bitcoin to buy a tesla all you want, but the government is still able to
        tax those transactions. The entire system is rendered useless under
        current format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important downside of using bitcoin as a currency is its
        unstable money supply which leads to massive electricity usage from
        bitcoin mining in the world. Bitcoin mining put in simple terms is just
        to reverse an intrinsically irreversible process related to hash
        functions. If one could find the input that creates the desired output,
        the person would be rewarded with an amount of bitcoin. Frankly, it is
        an interesting concept because ultimately a higher computational power
        is rewarded with money. But as mentioned earlier, such method takes
        massive amount of electricity and frankly it is a waste of resources.
        Also, it seems arbitrary that money should go to people with the most
        computational power. The most ridiculous thing is that there is a fixed
        amount of bitcoins in the world, and it just does not work as a long
        term money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a decentralized currency should work in the future to make payments
        both secure and free, it must answer the above concerns and have
        thoughtful and thorough designs. In the current cryptocurrency market,
        it is mainly a group of people trying to manipulate and take advantage
        of others, and others have no idea what is going on. Such phenomenon
        would do more harm than good to the blockchain technology in the short
        term because people would quickly regard it as a scam. The truth is
        blockchain is not a scam; it is a immature technology that is
        misunderstood and abused by many people. I hope to witness a functional
        and decentralized international currency one day.
