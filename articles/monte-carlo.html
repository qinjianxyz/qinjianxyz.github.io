      <hr />
      <p>Monte Carlo method is a powerful numerical method strengthened by modern computing power that solves all types of problems with an emphasis in probability and statistics. However, the technique is used much broader in engineering and social sciences as well. The grandiose sounding name actually has a simple underlying principle: finding the analytical nature of an event through random experiments.</p>
      <p>The most famous albeit perhaps not the most useful application of Monte Carlo method is to find the value of the irrational number π. One of the ways to approximate is to draw a circle and a square that perfectly encloses the circle. Then the next step is simple: randomly select points within the square and see how many of them land in the circle. How to randomly select points is another topic which will be discussed in a separate article, but we can assume that the points are truly randomly selected. The sobering answer is that we could use the number of points in the circle divides the total number of points and then multiplies by 4. Then we would have the approximate value of pi. From this application, we see that Monte Carlo method is easy to implement, and the only effort required is to set up the proper conditions.</p>
      <p>The application is much beyond finding π. There are a tremendous number of applications in the field of probability and statistics. The Monte Carlo method allows us to find the probability of a very complex event through simulation. The amazing thing is that we do not even need to understand the theories behind an event. For example, let us consider there are three decks of cards with jokers. You would draw 10 cards. In the first 5 cards, if a card is the suit of heart or the suit of diamond, we would replace the card, and redraw a card. But if the card is the suit of heart again, we would keep it. In the second 5 cards, if we draw a joker, we will replace the card and draw one more card. If it is a joker again, we would keep it. What is the probability of having exactly one joker and exactly one 5 of heart in the 10 cards? It is a complicated problem to analyze but we could just code the exact situation and run simulations for a million times. Then we could get a very close approximation of the actual result. That is the power of Monte Carlo.</p>
      <p>Monte Carlo is used beyond probability and very popular in the field of engineering. For example, determining the specifications of a final product with many components that have inaccuracies in manufacturing could be a nightmare for analytical method but simple for the Monte Carlo method. Ideally, we want to understand why something happens, but realistically that does not always happen especially when we analyze a complex problem. It might be possible to do but likely a waste of money. Monte Carlo allows engineers and scientists to directly get to the result of an event using randomness and simulation. What Monte Carlo method amazes me the most is not necessarily any specific application. There are many elegant and useful applications, and they are wonderful. However, what intrigues me the most is the way of thinking Monte Carlo method has presented all of us. We do not have to understand the middle steps in order to solve a problem, and I believe it speaks to the core of numerical method.</p>
