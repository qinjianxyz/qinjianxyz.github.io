      Why do we learn? Sometimes we learn just for fun, for the sake of it.
      Many topics are interesting in their own right. I often find myself
      reading articles on data science and probability even though I have no
      plan of becoming a data scientist. I sincerely find the content
      intrinsically interesting and would be potentially helpful for my future
      work.
    </p>
    <p>With that said, what occurs much more often is that students are trying very
      hard to learn without understanding why. This is a rampant phenomenon,
      and I firmly believe it is not given enough serious thoughts that it
      deserves. The most immediate outcome is that talented and hardworking
      students find themselves taking class after class and still have no clue
      on what they could do with the knowledge they obtained through hard
      work. This phenomenon has bothered me as well, so I have designed a
      robust system called “projectify learning” to ferociously and
      relentlessly fight back. The concept of a projectify learning is very
      simple. “Do something with your knowledge.” In fact, this is not a
      foreign or even a controversial idea. Most students would agree that
      they should do more projects involving real world applications to gain
      more value out of their education. The problem is that there are a lot
      of misconceptions of projects and many people simply do not know where
      to start. The goal of this article is to help people in these
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am just a student and I do not have enough experience to start a
      project.” Many people have the misconception that one would need 10
      years of experience in the industry and at least a master’s degree to
      start a project. Nothing can be further from the truth. We live in an
      era of information explosion, and we can learn anything we want
      basically for free. There are amazing sources of knowledge online, free
      courses, YouTube, etc. The upside is that anyone with the access to
      internet can learn. The downside of the is that we will never learn
      everything. It is actually not a downside but just a reality that we
      need to live with. The most important thing is just to start doing
      something. Expecting one would be more prepared to start a project after
      learning one more thing is like expecting one would become a better
      driver after biking one more mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I understand the benefits of projects and I want to start one, but
      I do not know where to start.” The best tip I can give is to look for
      cross-disciplinary opportunities. I have taken a course on material
      science and for a long time I did not know what I could do it. One day
      one of my engineer friends complained to me that it takes a long time to
      find the material she needs to use in her design project. It would be
      very helpful if a program could take in the parameters she wants and
      recommend 5 materials that best match her criterion. That clicks with me
      immediately. “Now, that is an industry problem.” I thought to myself. I
      quickly identified that the material selector is a multi-disciplinary
      challenge. It requires knowledge in material science and ultimately it
      is an optimization problem involving both categorical and numerical
      parameters, which is a great project idea. There are so more more
      examples like this where I have connected two seemingly irrelevant
      fields together to solve an real life problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, projectify learning is a thinking strategy. It is about
      taking one step further from the classroom to do something tangible and
      useful. This thinking strategy definitely needs practice, especially
      learning without practice is far too common in our educational
      institutions. With enough practice and understanding of this philosophy,
      I believe the concept of projectify learning could help individuals
      become better learners and better doers at the same time.
