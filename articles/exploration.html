    <p class="text-center"><b>Exploration and Exploitation</b></p>
    <hr />
    <p>There are many definitions of exploration and exploitation under different contexts. Before we dive into the
      discussion of exploration and exploitation, I want to clarify the definitions that I will be using in this
      article. Exploration happens when we try something new without knowing the likely outcome of it. We might have
      an idea of what could happen, but we do not know for sure. Exploitation happens when we resolve to an old way of
      doing things because we know for sure how it works. Again, there is no guarantee, and we might be surprised. But
      generally speaking, exploration offers more uncertainty.</p>

    <p>Imagine if you travel to a new city, and you know nothing about the city. In the evening, you want to go out
      and eat at a restaurant. Which one would you choose? Well, since we have just arrived, assuming that all
      restaurants have the same ratings, we must take a chance to choose a restaurant that we do not know for sure
      that we would like. A restaurant can have great ratings and most people absolutely love it, but that restaurant
      might just not be right for you. This is called exploration. When we explore a city, we want to discover the
      unknown with the hope that we would find something enjoyable. But what if we are leaving the city tomorrow and
      this is our last night in town. Would you want to go to a new restaurant or the best restaurant that you have
      had that you know for sure would give you a good experience. A new restaurant might be even better, but it can
      also be a lot worse. In this situation, most of us might choose to go the restaurant that we know, and this
      behavior is called exploitation. We exploit when we do not want to take a chance at finding a better option but
      instead choose the best option available at the moment.</p>

    <p>We can see how time plays an important role in the decision whether we choose to explore or exploit. When we
      are young, we have nothing to lose, and we are free to explore different industries and different parts of the
      world. We are more inclined to make new friends because we know we might meet our best friends or someone we
      really get along in the future. The best choice seems to be in the future. As we get older, we value family time
      much more. We want to spend time with our family not only because we love our family, but also because we know
      our family very well. It is difficult to completely surprise someone through people they have known for their
      entire lives. We are slow to make new friends because we think we have probably made our best friends. It is
      unlikely that we would meet somebody we like so much more in the future. The best seems to be in the past, not
      in the future. That is exactly when we start to exploit and stop exploring.</p>

    <p>We are not getting more insights on why someone would choose to explore over to exploit. If one believes the
      best is in the future, one would explore, and vice versa. Let us consider the movie industry. How would the
      movie industry make decision between exploration and exploitation? If investors invest more in new movies, made
      of completely anonymous actors, that would be considered as exploration, because the success is purely dependent
      on the quality of the movie. If the movie itself is not good, and there is no fame, no famous actor, there is no
      hope to succeed. If investors invest more in sequels, famous actors, in another way, things that are likely to
      succeed, this would be called exploitation. From the past decade, we can see how sequels have raked heavy
      profits. What does this tell us? Is the movie industry slowly dying? Does the movie industry believe the best is
      in the past? If we are conscious about the constant decision between exploration and exploitation, we can make
      better decisions to maximize our utility.</p>
