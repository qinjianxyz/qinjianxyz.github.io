    <hr />
    <p>Renewable energy has been a hot topic in the last decade (no pun intended). I personally believe Elon Musk has
      the right idea on this topic. It is not purely an issue of global warming, but also an issue of finite
      resources. I understand that global warming is a real crisis for the mankind, but the main reason I support
      renewable energy is that if we know that we will run out of fossil fuel one day, why not transition into a more
      sustainable source of energy before the cost of energy causes catastrophic collapse on our society. It just
      seems to be the more peaceful way to interact with the nature that ultimately has given us everything. If there
      is magic power that would make all fossil fuel disappear on earth, it is not responsible to use that power
      because that would make the global economy collapse. But this is the same reason we should take renewable energy
      seriously.</p>
    <p>The future we are building certainly requires a source of renewable energy. Over the last decade,
      cryptocurrency has been a popular topic that would theoretically replace the traditional sources of currency.
      In one of my articles, I talked about why crypto does not work yet, but it is certainly possible that a future
      version would work. But the main issue of cryptocurrency is its environmental impact, namely the consumption
      of electricity. It is a massive global system that drains so much energy from earth, and a lot of that energy
      is generated through unsustainable sources. Image if crypto becomes what it promises to be, decentralized,
      secure, tax free, private, etc., but the cost of electricity becomes too high for it to become productive.</p>

    <p>Facebook, now named Meta, floated the idea of a metaverse where people could do things in a virtual reality
      world. At this point, the company has suffered in losses because of no tangible products, but it does not
      mean that it cannot become a reality in the future. In the article explaining the benefits of a remote
      workforce, I talked about my passion to expand people’s ability to do things from home. But this again would
      require a tremendous amount of electricity.</p>

    <p>The automobile industry is heavily transitioning into electric vehicles. Tesla started out by making
      electric vehicles “SE3Y” (names of their models). Rivian gained a huge market valuation before selling a
      single car. Ford, Dodge, etc., begin making electric models. The future of transportation would certainly
      be heavily reliant on electricity.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that the future that we hope to achieve requires a lot of energy, and the cost of
      electricity is holding us back. If we have a sustainable way to produce electricity at little or no cost
      while preserving our nature, why not? It does not matter how long fossil fuel can sustain us before we
      finally run out of it. Of course, companies are going to make economically smart decisions, and I hope
      the time will arrive soon when using renewable energy is indeed the more cost-efficient and more
      environmental-friendly way of living. The myth of trading off quality vs ethics would no longer be true.
      We will have a future of clean energy and convenience made possible by technology, and this is the
      reason why I support sustainable energy.</p>
