        <hr />
        <p>Unfortunately, the Covid pandemic has taken so many precious lives away from us around the world. However, we
            need to admit that every time something as disruptive as the Covid pandemic happens, it often provides a
            novel or inspiring perspective. For example, some university students find online lectures difficult to
            follow and they are less motivated to study as home, while others appreciate the time saved from commute.
            But most of us agree that submitting homework online is a much better alternative than printing them out in
            paper. The ability to do what we used to do remotely presents ourselves a way to fundamentally change the
            structure of our society and solve many intractable problems of our time.
        </p>
        <p>We all have been to somewhere so beautiful, and the cost of living is significantly lower than our current
            residence and just go, “I wish I could live here if not for my job.” Since my parents were children, they
            were told they must go to big cities where opportunities, impactful companies and good paying jobs are. That
            is the only way to become somebody. To a large extent this belief has been true in the past decades because
            we were very limited by the physical world for work and prosperous cities represent prosperous citizens.
            However, the internet is breaking that barrier for us although people are so used to seeing people face to
            face and communicate through the vibration of air instead of signals passed through the internet. There is
            nothing intrinsically wrong with working with people face to face, but the unintended consequences for the
            younger generations are immense.
        </p>
        <p>When all the young people feel pressured to leave their hometown and compete in the big cities, the first
            thing that happens is that the real estate market explodes for both the employers and the employees. Costs
            for office buildings are significant for businesses, especially small businesses, which can be a barrier to
            compete in a competitive market. These money can be used for higher salaries to attract talented workers,
            better equipment, better management, funding for employee’s continual education, etc. Having a reliable
            remote workforce saves a lot of unnecessary cost for small businesses. Employees need to worry about the
            housing problem as well. After all, not everyone sleeps on their desk or the office floor. For example,
            Silicon Valley attracts a vast amount of talented engineers, and all the engineers need to find a place to
            live, whose demand drives up the price of local houses as well as cost of living. The millennials often joke
            around about how difficult it is for us to have our houses. The truth is that houses are not unaffordable –
            they are just not affordable where people want to live. The freedom to work remotely practically solves this
            issue.
        </p>
        <p>The biggest benefit of remote work is to decrease the wealth gap among cities or states, which is a wonderful
            thing for underdeveloped regions. There are many places in the world that are suitable for living and have
            access to internet, but do not have great job prospects. Imagine if people make good money and bring that
            money to different communities, the ripple effects of these actions would enrich their local communities at
            a scale and rate we could have never imagined before. I believe when the wealth gap among cities decreases,
            the wealth gap among individuals would also decrease and we would have a more equal society in terms of
            spending power, which would further increase the health, education levels, etc. of the population. In
            addition, when people go to underdeveloped cities where there are many opportunities and vacant industries,
            employees could become entrepreneurs much easier. I believe in the upcoming decades; it would be normalized
            for individuals to become entrepreneurs and employees at the same time. There is nothing preventing people
            to pursue their dreams and be an excellent employee for someone else at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>Another added benefit is that people could travel more nationally and internationally. A financial analyst in
            the United States could spend 3 months in Italy and another 3 months in Australia. I have always been a
            proponent of travelling when it is affordable because it diminishes so much of our unfounded ignorance and
            biases. When we travel, we could experience different cultures and often have new perspectives on how we can
            live our lives. For me, one of the most exciting things about being able to work remotely is the ability to
            travel around the world and still provide excellent quality service either to a company or to my own
            company. Of course, I cannot travel every day because there is a lot of work to do, but it is certainly
            reasonable to live in a new country every six months. Remember what I wrote about underdeveloped areas? In
            this case, people could travel all over the world and bring their money with them to consume, which would
            lead to international development.
        </p>
        <p>After all, I believe a remote workforce is about decentralization. It is about not concentrating everything
            into one place and leave no room to breathe. It offers people flexibility to choose where to live and when
            to work and their performance would be evaluated through their output they produce instead of how many hours
            they could sit in an office chair. These flexibility leads to more development in undeveloped countries,
            cities, and states. But why does equal development even matter? Why should we strive to develop
            underdeveloped regions? There are many good ethical reasons, but I will bring up a more logical answer.
            There is an interesting risk assessing concept called bus factor which evaluates how much setback would a
            project experience if a group member suddenly cannot fulfill their duties anymore. In the real world, the
            sudden leave can be caused by many reasons, such as injuries, mental health issues, pregnancy, or even
            death. If we rely everything on one person, when there is an accident associated with that one person, the
            entire group collapses. It is the exact same concept with centralized wealth in a few cities. If one day
            there is an unpredictable accident such as a natural disaster, would you prefer all valuable assets are
            cramped and destroyed together or more spread out across the country so less damage is done? Logical
            reasoning would tell us a more equal distribution is more risk tolerant. The same thing can be applied on a
            global scale. Having different countries develop more equally indeed increase our risk tolerance as a
            species.
        </p>
        <p>OK, if you are persuaded by the remote force and are excited about it, let’s get back to the fundamentals.
            How can we get there? There are manageable challenges we need to overcome before we could transition into a
            more mature remote workforce. All the challenges can be summarized into one question: “How can we maintain
            or improve our productivity and accountability online to the same level with face-to-face interactions which
            we are so used to?” There are several technologies that could facilitate this transition. Video conferencing
            applications like Zoom made video conferences with a large group of people a normal thing. We could add AR
            technology to video conferencing to add even more real feelings to it. We can have creative ideas to keep
            track of work progress. I believe in the upcoming decades there will be revolutionary concepts on how to
            effectively measure productivity of employees besides hours spent sitting. We can have better workflows set
            up for remote work where the organizational aspect of a traditional business can be better represented
            online. These are tough challenges folks, but it is achievable. An even more fundamental question is that
            how we even know if the remote workforce is helping companies instead of hurting them. Again, it requires a
            lot of creativity to answer this question. We can try A/B test for employees for satisfaction and
            productivity of work. We could offer the freedom for a small group of employees the option to work remotely
            and evaluate their performance.
        </p>
        <p>I want to clarify that I am a very social person. In fact, this past year without seeing a lot of my friends
            because they live oversea has been very tough on me. Some people might interpret my message for a more
            isolated society where social interactions are cut off. I want to state that this is not my intention at
            all. First, we do not need to cut all face-to-face interactions in workplace. Companies can have weekly,
            monthly, quarterly meetings where employees need to travel across the world to get to the meeting. There are
            real issues caused by the current model as extensively described in the previous paragraphs. Second, we can
            spend more time interacting with our communities and families like never before. If you live in a big city,
            do not pretend that you know your neighbors well. Most of us do not know who lives next door. If we have the
            flexibility to work anywhere, if we do not have to get up and commute to our workplace every morning, there
            is a good chance we can actually be involved in the community.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, we should remain open minded to experience new technology or even new ways of life and choose
            for ourselves. I think many people would still prefer the current work culture and would rather see their
            colleagues with their own eyes, which is absolutely great. I am a big component for choices. At the end of
            the days, we can all choose for ourselves in a free society. However, the ability to work online is not
            simply a matter of preferences as it solves challenging problems such as the housing crisis and inequality
            in our societies. So please take this factor into consideration in this topic. I am not sure how long it
            will take for this vision to manifest but I truly wish to see a world where people could work anywhere in
            the world and experience different cultures. Catch me typing my next article on my laptop in a safari in
            Masai Mara while petting a baby elephant or leopard.
