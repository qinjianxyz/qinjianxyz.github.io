    <hr />
    <p>When I was studying for the GRE test for graduate school application, I studied the vocabulary extensively
      since it was an important component. My attitude towards vocabulary transitioned from “I will probably never see
      any of these” to “this is absolutely amazing” in a matter of a few months. As a non-native speaker, I was not
      familiar with numerous academic and fancy words when I first started out preparing for GRE. The first impression
      I had was that I have never seen these words before, and I will probably never see them again. To my surprise,
      this immature conclusion cannot be further from the truth, and I admit wholeheartedly that I was wrong at first.
    </p>
    <p>There was a strange looking word in particular – ignominious, which means shameful. After memorized the meaning
      of the word and a few examples sentences in which the word is properly used, I thought to myself I will probably
      never see the word again. To my surprise, later that day, during the interview Stephen Colbert conducted with
      John Bolton, Stephen used the exact word ignominious. When I was watching the interview live, I just could not
      believe my ears. I did not expect this day to arrive so soon, not a few hours after I made the conclusion that I
      will not see the word in a very long time. What shocks me even more is that in the following days, I keep seeing
      the word ignominious in articles.</p>

    <p>After this encounter, I absolutely fell in love with vocabulary, specifically GRE vocabularies. It is not
      that these words are not widely used or not useful. It is because my knowledge was so limited to the extent
      that these words are not registering in my mind even when they appear in my life so often. It feels amazing to
      see the words I studied to appear in real life, so I know them even better. I ended up scoring 99% percentile
      in the GRE English test, and I give credits largely to how I truly fell in love with the vocabularies.</p>

    <p>This article is not all about vocabularies of course. I always love thinking a little bit deeper and
      analyze the underlying patterns and lessons I could apply to other issues. What I described above is just
      exponential compounding. Have you ever heard the idea that when a person is rich, it is even easier to get
      richer? It is the exact same idea. When a person knows something, then each time that something happens
      again, it will reinforce the initial learning. On the contrary, if the person does not have the initial
      knowledge, no matter how many times that thing shows up, it might be useless. It is the same idea when we
      try to learn a foreign language when we are not babies anymore. If we learn the basics and try to improve by
      watching movies or shows in the language we are trying to learn, we could gradually improve if we take our
      time to analyze. However, if we do not have the initial knowledge, regardless how much we watch or listen,
      we cannot learn that language.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I believe this phenomenon is a useful study strategy. The revelation about pattern recognition
      that could be incorporated by people from diverse fields.</p>
