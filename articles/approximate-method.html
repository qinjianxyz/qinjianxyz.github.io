      <hr />
      <p>
        In the scientific and engineering world, one might hold the assumption
        that accuracy is always a preferable trait. However, just like there are
        microeconomics and macroeconomics in the field of economics, it is also
        important for engineers to sometimes take a step back and look at the
        larger picture. There are many very complex questions that could be
        answered with an abstract and an approximate answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are there no insects in the cold weather? The first instinct is that
        there might be something to do with heat and energy, and that is a good
        place to start. If we use the approximate method, we need to substitute
        details with gross approximation. Let us consider the shape of an insect
        is approximately a cube. We know that animals lose heat through their
        surface area and general heat through every living cell. So, we can say
        the heat generating capacity is proportionally related with the volume
        of the insect and the heat losing capacity is proportionally related
        with the surface area of the insect. Let us define the cold weather
        resistance as heat generating capacity divided by heat losing capacity.
        Remember we approximated the insect as a cube. As a result, the heat
        generating capacity is in the order of length to the third power, and
        the heat losing capacity is in the order of length to the second power
        if we ignore the scaler 6 for each surface. The cold resistant ratio is
        in the order of length, which means that an animal with a higher
        “length” is more resistant to cold weather. We only used very basic
        conditions to reach this sobering result.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many more questions that can be answered by approximate
        method especially with complex systems. For example, why do human have
        legs instead of wheels? How many ping-pong balls can a Boeing 747 hold?
        These might seem like ridiculous questions but the ability to
        approximate almost everything is a valuable skill. When we solve modern
        problems, oftentimes we encounter extremely complex systems and instead
        of making sense of everything, it is often much more valuable to gain
        insight on what matters the most. In finance, economics, engineering,
        this can be called as the intuition when observing a system. Opponents
        of this way of thinking might propose that the approximation is too
        general, and no animal is exactly the shape of a cube. But this
        seemingly inaccurate way of thinking is in fact the power of the
        approximate method.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could think of heuristics as one subfield of approximate method. In
        computer science, there are inherently intractable problems due to a
        very high volume of calculations. Some problems might be solvable at a
        small scale, but grows at exponential or factorial speed, which proves
        the most powerful computer is not nearly sufficient against the law of
        nature. Scientists gradually realized that they could alter the nature
        of the problem they are solving. Instead of finding a perfect solution,
        maybe a “good” solution is truly good enough. There are ways to ease the
        tension through changing boundary conditions and ignoring constraints,
        but the ultimate purpose of heuristics is to transform the intractable
        problem into a solvable problem, with the sacrifice of accuracy that is
        most often negligible. We see heuristics in many applications today and
        the most widely used is in navigation maps. Instead of spending 30
        minutes to calculate every single route, the maps simply give us a good
        route depending on the current situation. It would be useless to find
        the best path anyway because the traffic is dynamic. By the time the
        calculation is finished, what used to be the best path might not be the
        best path after the calculation is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are numerous applications of approximate method, but what
        impresses me is the creative way of tackling a problem. When we face an
        intractable problem, we should ask what the ultimate purpose is of
        solving this problem in the first place. But once we have a clear
        picture of what we want to achieve, we have the freedom to moderately
        tweak the problem and conditions given to produce a useful result, which
        ultimately leads to profits.
