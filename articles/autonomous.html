    <hr />
    <p>Three months ago, we started with an empty chassis. The first step to building an autonomous vehicle was to
      build all of the electrical and mechanical components. The team designed and made a camera mount to detect the
      environment, a jetson nano case to protect the brain of our car, a remote emergency off switch to protect the
      car when it goes off the track and connected numerous other electrical components such as the electric speed
      controller to ensure the basic functionality of the car.</p>
    <p>With a fully functional car, we implemented the donkey car framework which is a deep learning framework that
      uses TensorFlow and other computer vision libraries. In this step, we did not write too much code because the
      deep learning model is already there. We collected data in different circumstances and calibrated the
      configurations such as neutral throttle voltage of the car to ensure the correct functionality. This is the
      first attempt of an autonomous vehicle self-driving on a track without human intervention.</p>

    <p>Moving on to something a bit more logical, we switched gear to the OpenCV library and ROS2 operating system.
      This time, instead of using deep learning, the car uses lane detection to calibrate its position every time the
      camera captures an image. There are dotted yellow lines in the middle of the track, and we calibrated the car so
      that the masked image only shows the color that we want, which is yellow in this case. There are other details
      that I won't get into here, such as denoising and quadrilateral detection. In the end, our car is able to drive
      on the track by identifying the patterns that it detects using OpenCV. ROS2 is the robotic operating system that
      allows different nodes to work together.</p>

    <p>After just simply driving on the track, the team wanted to add a bit more fun to our autonomous vehicle. We
      want the car to drive on the track and detect people in the surrounding who are not wearing masks. Once
      detected, the car would drop off a mask for them. This was an interesting and very flexible idea because the
      technology that we use to detect people without masks can be easily converted into other detections. There it
      is, the first Maskcar in the world. First, the team built a simple mask dispenser using 3D printing and a servo
      motor. The facial recognition is done by using a YOLOv5 model, which can accurately detect people wearing or not
      wearing a mask and gives a score between 0 to 1 depending on its confidence. Then the heavy lifting came when we
      integrated everything into a new ROS2 package, the mask_pkg.</p>

    <p>Looking back, there was a lot of work and energy poured into this car, and I could not have asked for better
      teammates than Quynh and Caitlin. It was common for us to work 8+ hours a day straight on this car debugging the
      code and troubleshooting the hardware. There was a lot of personal growth as well as collaboration.</p>
