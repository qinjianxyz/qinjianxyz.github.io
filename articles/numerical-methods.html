    <hr />
    <p>
      With increasing computational power, there comes increasing
      possibilities to tackle familiar problems with novel perspectives and
      creative techniques. Numerical method is one of many products of modern
      computational power, and it has become an essential component of
      scientific computing. This article introduces what numerical methods are
      and give some practical applications of it. The central idea of
      numerical method is to convert complex and often intractable analytical
      problems into solvable mathematical models to find an approximate
      solution to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many practical applications in numerical methods, such as
      finite element analysis, numerical integration, etc. We will look into
      root finding first. For example, try to solve this simple question: x^x
      = ln(x), what is the value x, assume x is a real number? (^ means power,
      2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8). One might quickly realize that this innocent looking
      equation is almost impossible to solve analytically. However, with a
      numerical technique called bisection, one can get a very close answer to
      the approximate value of the irrational solution to this equation. There
      are many numerical methods to solve this problem and bisection is just
      one of them.
    </p>

      Numerical methods play a vital role in modern engineering. Before
      computational power becomes an essential part of scientific or
      engineering research, if one wants to model the air flow through the
      wings of an airplane, there can be pages of complicated equations and
      derivations trying to incorporate every detail caused by the nuanced
      interactions between the wings and their surrounding air. There will be
      lift force, air drag, vibrations of wings, etc. But finite element
      analysis (FEA) has given engineers a new perspective to look at this
      problem. The idea of finite element analysis is to take a large
      component and break it down into infinitely small nodes connected by
      meshes. The effect of one node would be reflected by its neighbors and
      if the computational power allows us to have nodes close enough, we can
      get very accurate results. Much of this is done by matrix calculations,
      and the idea of FEA has been proposed long before today. But due to
      limitations of computational power in the past, no one can go through
      all of the matrix calculations by hand and obtain useful results from
      them. If we look at modern CAD software, Autodesk Inventor, Dassault
      Syst√®mes Solidworks, etc., all of their simulations are conducted by
      numerical methods instead of analytical methods. Finite element analysis
      is a simple yet sobering technique. Simplicity does not mean that the
      implementation is easy. On the contrary, the difficult part of FEA is
      during the setup of the problem. Engineers need to set the geometry,
      meshes, constraints, physical parameters properly so the model could
      work. Optimized meshes for arbitrary geometry is still an open problem
      that many researchers and industry professionals work on. In fact, a new
      field is emerging called computational science, whose core idea is to
      utilize mathematical models to solve complex problems. I believe in the
      upcoming decades this field would render tremendously valuable services.

      What fascinates me the most about numerical method is not about solving
      integration or find the stress and strain relationships of a complex
      structure. These are definitely elegant applications, but what interests
      me the most is that numerical methods a new way of thinking about
      engineering problems. The big lesson I have learned from numerical
      methods is that we could break down a complex problem into arbitrarily
      small problems and solve them bottom up. This is like the divide and
      conquer in sorting algorithm which has made computing so much more
      efficient. There is so much more practical use of numerical methods, and
      this article only gives a brief introduction of the topic. The
      increasingly popular field of machine learning is built on numerical
      methods. It is a way of thinking that scientists and engineers should
      look into, and I believe the proper incorporation of numerical methods
      of any field would render useful services.
