    <hr />
    <p>What does it mean to own something? Holding something in our hands? Having full control over it? Private
      ownership has always been a fascinating topic to me because in my opinion it has fundamentally created the
      worldwide prosperity that we see today. People are motivated to own things for themselves and for their
      families.</p>

    <p>I am certain that most people believe each of us at least owns some stuff. For example, there is no debate
      that we own our bodies, and we own our lives. I seem to own my phone since I paid money for it and nobody
      besides a thief would claim otherwise. But if I pick up a stone that nobody wants and bring it home, do I own
      that stone? Well, that question goes much beyond this scale. What does it mean for someone to own their land?
      Well, they have had the control of the territory over the past decades, centuries or perhaps even longer, but
      what grants the legitimacy of their ownership? Going back to the previous example, my ownership of my body can
      be destroyed easily if I meet a wild tiger in their natural habitat. I don’t think the tiger will have the
      patience for me to explain the complicated terms on ownership. Young children are taught to take ownership of
      their lives, which means being independent, self-motivated, and essentially taking on the world by themselves.
      Ownership appears to be a positive thing. Afterall most people go to work with the knowledge that they will
      own their salaries, which can be used to get access to food, housing, etc.</p>
    <p>There is another extremely important term to the western countries – democracy. In essence, the word
      democracy means that the will of the people – the mass – should be used as the guideline for a country. Most
      often that spirit is reflected through voting. In the United States, we elect our representatives through
      voting. These representatives make laws that all citizens must follow to ensure the proper functioning of our
      society. I started pondering about this topic when more and more politicians start talking about taxing
      companies for their profits. I am not sure where I stand on this topic. I am a capitalist myself, and I
      believe some of the richest people and companies brought so much value and utilities into our lives. But I
      also understand that the law is made by representatives elected by the people, and there are legal ways to tax
      companies that ultimately profit from the people.</p>

    <p>Is there an inherent conflict between democracy and private ownership? If the entire population believes that
      they own something someone else has created, who owns that something?</p>
