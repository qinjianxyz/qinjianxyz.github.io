    <hr />
    <p>Data structure in a well-known topic in Computer Science. We study how to efficiently structure our data with
      respect to time, space, and cognitive load. For example, a linked list is fast at adding additional nodes, while
      slow at finding a node with linear traversal. But this article is not about data structure in computer science.
      Instead, it is about data structure that we can find in our lives.</p>
    <p>Most of us have some sort of a to-do list. One day I suddenly realized that a to-do list fundamentally is a
      data structure of strings or things that we need to accomplish. If you simply use a calendar, and all of the
      events are in chronological order, that is a queue. Earlier events are always processed first. This could be an
      efficient data structure if you are good at finishing tasks on time. But sometimes, people might think that
      there are still a lot of time left until there are only days left on a big project that would take weeks.
      Putting everything on a calendar does not entirely reflect how urgent or how much resources need to be allocated
      for that task.</p>
    <p>Another choice is to have a priority queue. Instead of keeping things in a chronological order, we order the
      task by their magnitude of their urgency. If something is important and needs to be done first, it shows up on
      the list first. After all, chronological order does not encompass the importance of a task. This is the to-do
      list that I personally use most of the time. This allows me to get the more important tasks done first and have
      less stress so I can perform better.</p>
    <p>If you are really extreme, you can consider using a stack as your to-do list. This is only recommended for
      workaholics who would not keep anything on their to-do list. The way this works is that you would only do
      earlier tasks if you have finished everything added after. This means that you would need to finish your paper
      due next week first before doing your homework due tomorrow night. I have tried this a few times before where I
      would work on a project due much later first. This causes extreme stress but sometimes it can also bring extreme
      productivity.</p>
    <p>For people who have built data structures in real life, it is understood that the best data structure can be a
      combination of a number of different data structures. We could use different linear structures for different
      tasks. Also, the data structure in life goes much beyond array, queue, and stack. I am sure this has been
      discovered before, but a lot of data structures are inspired by real life events. A graph is inspired by social
      connections drawn out on a board.</p>
    <p>We might quickly realize that optimization can only go so far. The best way to optimize our to-do list to
      finish tasks fast so that the list is never too long. This is just like optimizing tasks to be done for a CPU by
      the operating system. Regardless of the efficiency of the optimization, the key is to get the task done.</p>
