    <p class="text-center"><b>Ethics in Product Engineering</b></p>
    <hr />
    <p>When I was younger, ethics seemed like something so vague and so far away. I think it is very common, though.
      When I was in high school, I was still pretty much clueless on how I could make an impact in the world, let
      alone thinking about ethics. But, as time progresses, I have come to understand how products shape our world and
      the responsibility for engineers to emphasize and take ethics into consideration when developing a product. When
      I first read about how a bridge was designed to segregate communities because bus cannot go under the bridge, I
      was shocked. I was not even disguised by the design intent at first; I was just in a state of shock. I have
      always thought that a product is something that facilitates our lives in some regard, and I never thought it can
      be used to achieve such insidious intent. Ever since, for every product I have ever touched, from software to
      hardware, I kept thinking about that bridge, thinking about ways that the products might violate ethics.</p>

    <p>Ethics can be summarized to be moral principles that guide our actions, which is a very broad definition. The
      first step we can take towards a more ethical product is to make our product more inclusive and accessible. We
      can start by asking, can everyone in the world use our product? How about visually or hearing-impaired people?
      What about color blindness? Are these people left behind from our product? Is our product respectful for all
      cultures in the world? If not, for what reasons? Are these reasons resolvable? Does our product have the
      potential to harm our customers? If our database is attacked, how much losses do our customers need to bear?
      Will our products cause mental or physical harm to our customers? If our product can be more addicting and
      generate more revenue for the company but would cause mental illness or severe stress, what should we do? These
      are a couple of endless questions engineers and product managers need to constantly ask themselves.</p>

    <p>I believe the most important aspect in ethics is humility and good intention. Even if we make a mistake, which
      we all do, we are humble enough to recognize it and improve our product for the better. I hope companies are not
      deliberately making decisions that would sacrifice the wellbeingâ€™s of their customers for more temporary
      profits. Because I firmly believe if the company treats their customers like their family, they will be rewarded
      accordingly. I am a very tolerant person and believe in personal growth. We all have our biases in different
      ways. Even if we have worked so hard on eliminating conventional biases, such as race, gender, religion, we are
      so far away from being bias free. In fact, I think it is impossible to be unbiased about everything unless we
      are knowledgeable about every single detail of the human race, which is impossible. If perfection is impossible,
      to me, the meaning of ethics in product engineering has become the process of continuous improvement.</p>
