    <hr />
    <p>As one of the largest social media company Facebook changed its parent company to “Meta,” people much more
      often start hearing terms such as cryptocurrency, NFT, metaverse, etc. People are wondering whether it is
      possible to have a virtual world as real as the one we live in right now. I can play games like GTA and
      Minecraft and be in first person view, but I am not sure if that counts as a metaverse. Indeed, we need
      precisions and flexibility much more than these. We need to be able to dig under the ground and build a house
      from scratch if we want to. All these imaginations require physical simulation.</p>
    <p>The power of physical simulation is not first discovered by internet companies. In engineering software
      companies such as ANSYS and Autodesk, the value of physical simulation has been realized a long time ago.
      Computer Aided Design (CAD) is crucial for designs of most products. Finite Element Method and other numerical
      methods are used to design and test the engineering design of a product. For example, physical simulation of
      automobiles and airplane wings drastically reduce the cost of iterative design compared to building a physical
      product for and physically test for every iteration. The article on numerical methods on modern engineering has
      a more detailed description on this topic.</p>
    <p>Physical simulation can change the concept of time. This is a straightforward concept. Since we know how
      gravity works, we do not have to wait for something to fall. Instead, we could calculate its projectiles.
      Physical simulation works the same way. If we understand how different objects would interact with each other,
      we can speed up time. For example, if we understand how chemicals interact, we could speed up the reaction
      process which would slash costs for researchers. If we understand how bacteria reproduce and infect other parts
      of our body, we could simulate treatment for certain diseases. There are already simulations for human hearts
      that would be helpful to understand the delivery of medication, even though we are far from simulating the
      entire human body.</p>
    <p>If we can modify the concept of time, we can do a lot of things such as speeding up biomedical development.
      Scientists no longer needs to wait for experiments given that the physical simulation model is accurate enough.
      This technology would drastically save costs for scientists, researchers, and engineers. If we can make the
      physical simulation so realistic, we would create a world identical to the one that we live in right now. This
      idea hints that the world we live in right now could be a simulation itself. I am neither the first person to
      propose this theory, nor do I fully believe this theory. But an interesting question to consider is that if we
      were to live in a simulation, what would the purpose be? Why would somebody else run this simulation on us? Or
      we can consider another question. If we have the capacity to run a simulation as realistic as the one we live in
      right now, and a quark is the smallest unit, for what purpose would we run that simulation?</p>
