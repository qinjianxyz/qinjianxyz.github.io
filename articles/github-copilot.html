        <hr />
        <p>Recently a new technology called GitHub Copilot has become the focus of conversations for many software
            engineers and developers. To summarize in one sentence, GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence helper
            that could predict and assist the programmers to finish their code. The Copilot has excellent performance on
            technical questions such as LeetCode and Code Wars, and users have found the predictions fairly accurate and
            useful. By no means it is a perfect piece of software yet. As many developers point out, when there are many
            ways of achieving the same goal, the Copilot seems to lack a little bit in the creativity, and even
            efficiency.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the Copilot has room for improvement does not make it less threatening to many people.
            It gives developers a glimpse that perhaps what they do can be substituted by artificial intelligence
            just like other professions, like teachers, doctors, lawyers, waiters, etc. Even though the helper is
            nowhere close to substituting real life software engineers in the industry, it is quite possible that
            many entry positions would be indeed substituted in the upcoming years or decades.</p>
        <p>How do I feel about this? I think it is absolutely great. We are always caught up in the discussion
            of innovation vs tradition, and I would pick up innovation every time even if it directly impacts
            me. We are always scared of new things because we do not want to lose how good we have it now. But
            what I always remind myself is that we, as human, are always creators first, competitors second.
            Since the technological revolution began, human has almost always found a way to reduce repetition
            of human labor with technology. Cars to walking, as printers to writing, etc. Coding is the same.
            There is a constant combination of creativity and repetition, and the latter part can be substituted
            like anything else. In my opinion, if the machine can do something, maybe it is time for us to look
            for something else to do. I have always believed in the flexibility and creativity in human and
            think no one should be tied down to a job or position. The industry and the entire society are
            constantly changing, and I truly enjoy these dynamics. I think I enjoy the dynamic movement even
            more than where it is taking us. I love constantly learning new things and the fact that one
            profession might be substituted by machines simply does not concern me at all. In fact, I believe
            there is enough resources on earth for every single human being to have a fulfilling and happy life,
            and it is up to us to create and compete to get there. At the end of the day, human use tools, and
            human are not tools. I think much of the panic of this invention is that people are so focused and
            caught up in a particular set of skills to the point where they have become the skills themselves. I
            think the cautionary tale is that we must always remain open minded and prevent such thing from
            happening.</p>
        <p>I have one advice to deal with the anxiety. If it is possible, maybe grow our own food. Maybe
            that could help people worry less. Our society has become very brain-centric to the extent that
            most of us do not know how to harness the pseudo-infinite energy source, the creator of all –
            the sun. What do we worry about the most if we are out of work? If suddenly, all the human
            labors are substituted by machines, what do we worry about? Maybe we would worry about food?
            Naturally, there might not be enough food for everyone if the market collapses. At the end of
            the day, we worry that we will starve. So why not solve the root cause of our worries? I have
            always been interested in agriculture, automation, and energy. If automation is so advanced, it
            is much easier for us to farm and grow our food. If we could take the premise that we will not
            starve, regardless how powerful the GitHub Copilot is, the technology seems much less
            threatening and dangerous. The truth is, by the time technology such as GitHub Copilot replaces
            human programmers, there are probably so much more new stuff going on in the world for us to
            work on. Imagine, in the past, for scientific breakthroughs, there were no computers or even
            calculators. There might have been jobs where people would just manually calculate numbers. Yes,
            calculators have substituted those jobs, for the better. Let us just keep doing what we are best
            at – to create and leave the rest in history.</p>
